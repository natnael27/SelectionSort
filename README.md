# SELECTION SORT
Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that divides the input list into a sorted and an unsorted region. 
It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on the order) element from the unsorted region and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted region. 
This process continues until the entire list is sorted.

In this Python code, the selection sort function takes an array as input and sorts it using the selection sort algorithm. 
The example usage at the end initializes an array, prints the original array, performs selection sort, and then prints the sorted array.
